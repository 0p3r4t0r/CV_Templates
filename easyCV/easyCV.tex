\section{Teaching}
4 years total teaching experience, starting from the beginning of college 
as a private tutor for chemisty and biology.
I later began volunteer work with a local organization to provide tutoring
to inner city students.  By Junior year I was hired as a teaching assistant in physics,
where I worked until graduation.  My experience in teaching allows me to quickly discern
a student's progress, and optimize my approach to ensure we maximize productivity.  


\section{Japanese}
2 years of independent study.
Have read 2 novels and am currently working through 
the Japanese Edition of \textit{The Wonders of Physics}.  Though I understand that
classes are to be conducted in English, my knowledge of the Japanese language provides
an understanding of how the students are thinking, 
and helps me better explain any corrections that need to be made.

\section{\LaTeX}       
Highly proficient in the use of \LaTeX.  Able to create worksheets,
notes, or other study aids.  Have 2 years experience and am able to write .cls files
for custom document formatting.  

\section{Computers}
Comfortably familiar with OSX and Windows operating systems,
as well as common linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Mint.
Able to use a variety of communication software including Skype
and Google Hangouts.  Comfortable working and speaking through a web-interface
and likely able to help students solve technological problems
related to microphone or camera use.  Experience with USB, linein, and internal hardware.

\section{Work Experience}

\subsection{Teaching Assistant}{Aug. 20XX --- May 20XX at XXXXXXXXXX}
\begin{mainlist}
\item PHY101 \& PHY102 -- Algebra based course set intended for science students whose majors do not directly pertain to physics.  Covered classical mechanics to electrodynamics with a brief introduction to special relativity.
\item PHY203 \& PHY204 -- Calculus based equivalent of the above.  Intended for physicists and engineers, these courses require a deeper understanding of the concepts, as well as the ability to derive equations independently.
\end{mainlist}

\subsection{Student Technologist}{Jun. 20XX --- Sept. 20XX at XXXXXXXXXX}
\begin{mainlist}
\item Assisted faculty with a variety of computer problems: repair of malfunctions, antivirus, hardware upgrades, etc. 
\item Assembled and dismantled machines including internal components such as CD drives.
\item Prepared teaching labs for student use by installing prerequisite software and ensuring uniform configurations across all machines.  Worked with DeepFreeze software to update machines and prevent students from making unauthorized changes.
\end{mainlist}

\subsection{Research Assistant}{May 20XX --- Aug. 20XX at XXXXXXXXX}
\begin{mainlist}
\item Aided faculty as needed in conducting research on various plant varieties.  Duties varied widely on a day-to-day basis.  Everything from caring for plants in the greenhouse, to producing agar plates for the cultivation of soil microbes.
\item Work conditions were often outdoors, even in inclement weather.  Learned to work under a variety of conditions and to ignoring distractions while collecting data.
\end{mainlist}

\section{Education}
\subsection{University}{Aug. 20XX --- May 20XX}
